Parts may of course be replaced by functionally compatible ones, for example use a fork lift relais for the main power relais (relais & fuses are no special parts). Błażej Błaszczyk has built his [prototype](Prototype-Blazej.md) without using Renault parts. For details please contact him at <blazej.blaszczyk@pascal-engineering.com>.

## Arduino

**Note**: if you plan to use **Pascals integrated Twizy BMS**, you won't need an Arduino. The integrated BMS also implements the Twizy protocol.

For a basic setup you'll need an Arduino, a CAN interface and a relais to switch the 3MW signal.

If you want/need to measure cell voltages and temperatures with the Arduino, you will most probably need some analog input extension. A very simple and cheap setup for up to 16 cells is to use an analog multiplexer based on the CD74HC4067 chip.

Standard Arduinos can be powered from 12V, but will burn the voltage difference (convert to heat), so a step-down voltage regulator is highly recommended. The [Pololu A-Star SV series](https://www.pololu.com/category/149/a-star-programmable-controllers) has on-board step-down regulators suitable for a 12V supply.

Using an Arduino Uno style main board with shields reduces soldering requirements but needs more money and space than for example a Nano based board with break out components.

Keep in mind for all setups, this is an automotive application: expect high levels of mechanical stress due to road shocks and temperature expansion/contraction. Protect your electronics against humidity.

**Price note**: there are lots of cheap Arduino clones available. These can of course be used as well. Expect a lower build quality, so better order some spares (always a good idea).
